Profile Your Code:
    Use cProfile or line_profiler to identify bottlenecks.

Analyze Hotspots:
    Focus on optimizing the areas consuming the most time or resources.

Optimize Algorithms:
    Choose more efficient algorithms (e.g., quicksort over bubblesort).

Use Efficient Data Structures:
    Replace generic ones with optimized alternatives (e.g., deque for queues).

Optimize Loops:
    Vectorize computations with numpy or use itertools for memory-efficient iteration.

Parallelize Tasks:
    Use multiprocessing or asyncio for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks.

Caching Results:
    Use functools.lru_cache for expensive repeated computations.
