# Escape sequences in Python strings
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example uses escape sequences in strings so you can include
# characters that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to type
# directly.
#
# Special characters:
# - `\n` for new line
# - `\t` for tab
# - `\\` for backslash
# - `\'` for single quote
# - `\"` for double quote

print("Hello\nWorld")           # Print new line inside string
print("He said, \"Goodbye\"")   # Print double quotes inside string
# Output:
# Hello
# World
# He said, "Goodbye"
