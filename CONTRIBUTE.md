## 4. Project Conventions

### 4.1. File Naming

* Kebab-case for file names and directories (e.g., `part-a-basics.adoc`)
* Snake-case for Python files (e.g., `part_a_basics.py`)

### 4.2. Commit Messages

* (`#<id>`) - Use as a reference to a concrete issue number (either GitHub or JIRA)
* [`#####`] - No issue or ticket defined for this commit

**Examples**:
```
* (`#19`) - Add the operator precedence examples
* [`#####`] - Move the image assets to a dedicated folder
```

### 4.3. Issues Titles

[`<part>, <chapter>`] - \<message>

* The square brackets define the context (optional)
* The context is connected to a place in the document
* The square brackets are omitted if no context is needed

**Examples**:
```
* [Part A, Ch. 1] - Do this (with context)
* Do that (without context)
```
