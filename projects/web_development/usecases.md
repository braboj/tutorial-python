## Python Web Development Use Cases

### Web API Development
Create RESTful or GraphQL APIs to expose data and services for web or mobile
clients, using frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or Django REST Framework.

### Full-Stack Web Applications
Build complete websites with server-side rendering, templating, and database
integration via Django or Flask paired with frontend tech like React or Vue.

### Real-Time Applications (WebSockets)
Implement chat apps, live notifications, or collaborative tools using ASGI
servers (e.g., Uvicorn) and libraries like Django Channels.

### Content Management Systems (CMS)
Develop custom CMS platforms or plugins to manage articles, media, and user
roles, leveraging Django’s built-in admin or Wagtail.

### E-Commerce Platforms
Power online stores with product catalogs, shopping carts, and payment
processing through frameworks like Saleor or Oscar.

### Dashboard & Analytics Tools
Deliver interactive admin dashboards, data visualization, and reporting
interfaces using libraries such as Plotly Dash or Bokeh.

### Microservices Architecture
Decompose monoliths into independent services communicating over HTTP or
message brokers (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ) for scalability and resilience.

### Authentication & Authorization Systems
Implement secure login flows, social auth, JWT tokens, and role-based access
controls with packages like Django Allauth or Auth0 integrations.

### Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
Serve APIs for React, Angular, or Vue frontends, handling CORS, rate limiting,
and caching at the Python backend.

### Prototyping & MVPs
Rapidly build proof-of-concept web apps to validate ideas, thanks to Python’s
concise syntax and rich ecosystem.

### Serverless Web Services
Deploy functions as a service (FaaS) endpoints on AWS Lambda or Google Cloud
Functions using frameworks like Zappa or chalice for zero-server upkeep.

### Headless CMS & GraphQL
Combine headless content backends (Strapi, Directus) or GraphQL endpoints
with any frontend to deliver decoupled architectures.

### Workflow Automation Interfaces
Offer web dashboards to trigger and monitor background tasks, cron jobs, and
data pipelines via Celery or RQ integrations.
