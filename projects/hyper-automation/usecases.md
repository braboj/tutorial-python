## Hyperautomation Use Cases with Python

### Process Discovery & Mining  
Use Python tools (Pm4Py, Pandas) to ingest event logs, apply process‐mining  
algorithms, and visualize end‐to‐end workflows for inefficiency detection.

### RPA & Workflow Automation  
Leverage RPA frameworks (TagUI for Python, Robot Framework) alongside  
`pywinauto` or `PyAutoGUI` to automate repetitive UI tasks across desktop  
and web applications.

### AI-Driven Decisioning  
Integrate transformer models (via Hugging Face Transformers) and custom  
ML pipelines (scikit-learn, PyTorch) to recommend next-best actions or  
automatically classify and route cases.

### Integration & Orchestration  
Use Apache Airflow or Prefect DAGs, combined with Python SDKs for SAP,  
Salesforce or AWS (`boto3`), to orchestrate multi-system data flows and  
end-to-end processes.

### Intelligent Document Processing  
Combine OCR (Tesseract, EasyOCR) and NLP (spaCy, NLTK) to extract, validate  
and categorize data from invoices, forms and contracts.

### Monitoring & Analytics  
Build Python dashboards (Plotly Dash, Streamlit) to track automation  
KPIs—throughput, error rates, SLA compliance—and trigger alerts via  
`prometheus_client` or custom probes.

### Exception Handling & Self-Healing  
Implement Python‐based bots that detect failures in pipelines and invoke  
remediation scripts (retries, environment resets, user notifications).

### Compliance & Audit Trail  
Automate capture of audit logs and generate compliance reports with Pandas  
and Jinja2, ensuring traceability for GDPR, SOX or ISO standards.
