## Computer Vision Use Cases with Python

### Image Classification  
Train models with TensorFlow, PyTorch or Keras to label images into  
predefined categories for tasks like defect detection or animal species ID.

### Object Detection  
Use OpenCV or PyTorch-based libraries (e.g. Detectron2, YOLOv5) to locate  
and classify multiple objects in images or video frames.

### Semantic Segmentation  
Apply U-Net or DeepLab implementations in Python to assign a class label to  
each pixel, enabling precise scene understanding.

### Instance Segmentation  
Combine object detection and segmentation with Mask R-CNN or  
Matterport’s implementation to separate individual object masks.

### Facial Recognition & Analysis  
Leverage dlib, face_recognition or DeepFace for identifying individuals,  
emotion detection, and age/gender estimation.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  
Integrate Tesseract or EasyOCR with Python wrappers to extract and process  
text from scanned documents and images.

### Video Analytics & Tracking  
Implement background subtraction, multi‐object tracking or action detection  
using OpenCV and DeepSORT for surveillance and sports analysis.

### Augmented Reality Overlays  
Use OpenCV and OpenGL bindings in Python to detect markers or features and  
render virtual objects in live camera feeds.

### 3D Reconstruction & Depth Estimation  
Utilize OpenCV’s stereo vision modules or PyTorch-based depth networks to  
generate 3D point clouds and depth maps.

### Medical Imaging & Diagnostics  
Process MRI, CT or X-ray data with SimpleITK and PyTorch to detect tumors,  
segment organs, and assist radiologists.

### Automated Quality Inspection  
Apply computer vision pipelines in Python to inspect manufactured parts,  
detect defects, and enforce tolerance thresholds on production lines.

### Gesture & Pose Recognition  
Use OpenPose or MediaPipe Python APIs to interpret human poses and gestures  
for HCI, gaming or physical therapy applications.
