## Data Science Use Cases with Python

### Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** use Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore  
  datasets, summarize statistics, and uncover patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing:** apply SciPy or statsmodels for  
  t-tests, ANOVA, regression diagnostics, and significance testing.
- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:** design and analyze experiments with  
  statsmodels or SciPy to measure impact and optimize features.

### Visualization
- **Static Charts:** generate histograms, box plots, scatter plots with  
  Matplotlib and Seaborn for distribution and relationship insights.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** build dynamic UIs with Plotly Dash, Bokeh, or  
  Streamlit to let users filter and explore data in real time.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** visualize spatial data using GeoPandas, Folium, or  
  Kepler to plot maps and choropleths.
- **Network Graph Visuals:** render network diagrams with NetworkX and Plotly  
  to illustrate relationships between entities.

### Modeling
- **Predictive Modeling:** train regression and classification models with  
  scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM for forecasting and decision support.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** use Prophet, statsmodels, or ARIMA to model  
  trends and seasonality in temporal data.
- **Clustering & Segmentation:** apply K-Means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical  
  clustering for customer segmentation or anomaly grouping.  
- **Recommendation Systems:** build collaborative or content-based recommenders  
  with Surprise or implicit for personalized suggestions.
- **Anomaly Detection:** detect outliers with PyOD, isolation forests, or  
  autoencoders for fraud or fault detection.

### Data Engineering & Big Data
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** use Pandas and SQLAlchemy for ETL and data  
  wrangling tasks to prepare datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** automate feature creation and transformation with  
  Featuretools or custom Python scripts.
- **Big Data Processing:** process large datasets in parallel with PySpark or Dask  
  for scalable ETL and analytics.
- **Workflow Automation:** orchestrate data pipelines and tasks using Airflow,  
  Prefect, or Luigi.

### Deployment & Operations
- **Automated Reporting:** generate PDF or HTML reports via Jinja2 templates and  
  Python scripts, scheduled with Airflow or cron.
- **Model Deployment & MLOps:** containerize models with Docker, deploy via  
  Kubernetes, and manage versions with MLflow.
- **CI/CD for Data Science:** integrate tests and deployments with Jenkins, GitHub  
  Actions, or GitLab CI using Python-based workflows.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** implement model and data health checks with  
  Prometheus, Grafana, or custom Python probes.

### Specialized Domains
- **Natural Language Processing:** preprocess text and train models with NLTK,  
  spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Computer Vision Pipelines:** prepare image datasets and annotations using  
  OpenCV and custom scripts.
- **IoT & Sensor Data Analytics:** ingest and analyze real-time streams with MQTT,  
  InfluxDB, and Python collectors.
- **Social Network Analysis:** study graph structures and metrics with NetworkX  
  and graph databases like Neo4j.
