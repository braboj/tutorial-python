## Deep Learning Use Cases with Python

### Image Classification  
Train convolutional neural networks with TensorFlow or PyTorch to label images  
for tasks like medical diagnosis, wildlife monitoring, or retail cataloging.

### Object Detection & Localization  
Use models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN in Python to identify and locate objects  
in images or video for surveillance, quality control, and robotics.

### Semantic & Instance Segmentation  
Implement U-Net or Mask R-CNN pipelines with Keras or Detectron2 to delineate  
precise object boundaries in medical imaging or autonomous driving.

### Natural Language Processing  
Leverage Hugging Face Transformers in Python for tasks such as text  
classification, named entity recognition, translation, and summarization.

### Speech Recognition & Synthesis  
Build end-to-end models with TensorFlow’s Speech Commands or PyTorch’s  
torchaudio to convert audio to text or generate lifelike speech.

### Time Series Forecasting  
Apply LSTM, GRU, or Temporal Convolutional Networks in Keras to predict  
stock prices, energy demand, or sensor readings over time.

### Anomaly Detection  
Use autoencoders or variational autoencoders in Python to detect unusual  
patterns in network traffic, manufacturing data, or financial transactions.

### Recommendation Systems  
Combine deep learning embeddings with collaborative filtering using Python  
libraries to deliver personalized product or content suggestions.

### Generative Models & GANs  
Train Generative Adversarial Networks in TensorFlow or PyTorch to create  
realistic images, data augmentation, or art generation.

### Reinforcement Learning  
Implement algorithms like DQN or PPO with Stable Baselines3 or RLlib to  
train agents for games, robotics, and resource optimization.

### Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning  
Leverage pretrained models (ResNet, BERT) in Python to adapt to new domains  
with limited data, speeding up development and improving accuracy.

### Healthcare & Bioinformatics  
Apply deep models in Python for drug discovery, genomic sequence analysis,  
and personalized treatment planning using libraries like DeepChem.
