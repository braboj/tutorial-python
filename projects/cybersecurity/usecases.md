## Cybersecurity Use Cases with Python

### Threat Detection & Monitoring
Leverage Python libraries like Scapy and PyShark to analyze network traffic  
in real time for anomalies and intrusion attempts.

### Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing
Use python-nmap or build custom scanners with Paramiko and the Metasploit  
Python API to identify and exploit security flaws.

### Incident Response & Forensics
Automate log collection and forensic analysis with Volatility and Sleuth Kit  
bindings in Python scripts.

### SIEM Automation & Integration
Develop ETL pipelines in Python to ingest, parse, and correlate logs for  
SIEM platforms like Splunk or the Elastic Stack.

### Identity & Access Management Automation
Script user provisioning and permissions audits via Python SDKs for AWS IAM  
or Azure AD.

### Application Security Testing
Integrate Bandit for SAST and OWASP ZAP Python API for DAST into CI/CD  
pipelines.

### DevSecOps Pipeline Integration
Embed security checks in Jenkins or GitHub Actions using Python-based tools  
and custom scripts.

### Endpoint Detection & Response
Deploy Python agents with frameworks like OSSEC or write custom monitoring  
scripts.

### Threat Intelligence & Hunting
Gather and process threat feeds using Python requests and Pandas for data  
analysis and enrichment.

### Encryption & Key Management
Manage keys and certificates programmatically with Pythonâ€™s cryptography and  
PyOpenSSL libraries.

### SOAR Playbook Automation
Automate security playbooks with Python integrations for tools like Phantom  
or Demisto.

### Compliance Reporting & Audit Automation
Generate GDPR or PCI DSS compliance reports by extracting data with Python  
and formatting outputs via Jinja2 templates.
