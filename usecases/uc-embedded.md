## Embedded Systems Use Cases with Python

### Microcontroller Programming
Use MicroPython or CircuitPython to write firmware for boards such as Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, and Adafruit Circuit Playground.

### Sensor Data Acquisition
Interface with analog and digital sensors using I2C, SPI, and UART protocols to collect environmental and operational readings.

### Edge Computing & ML Inference
Deploy lightweight ML models on devices using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers or ONNX Runtime to perform inference locally.

### Home Automation & Smart Devices
Control lights, thermostats, and appliances through MQTT, HTTP or CoAP using Python MQTT clients and asyncio for event handling.

### Robotics & Motion Control
Implement servo and motor control, path planning, and feedback loops on embedded platforms with Python bindings to hardware libraries.

### Industrial Automation & SCADA
Integrate PLCs and industrial sensors, orchestrate data flows, and execute control logic with Python scripts on edge gateways.

### Wearable Technology & Health Monitoring
Develop firmware for wearables that track biometrics, manage power, and communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy using Python libraries.

### Automotive & Telematics
Run diagnostics, CAN bus communication, and over-the-air updates on vehicle systems with Python on embedded Linux or microcontroller units.

### Prototyping & Education
Rapidly prototype circuits and interactive projects with Python on boards like Micro:bit and Adafruit STEM hardware.

### Network Gateways & IoT Hubs
Bridge sensor networks to the cloud, manage TLS connections, and handle MQTT topics with Python running on Raspberry Pi or similar SBCs.

### Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting
Continuously monitor system metrics, detect anomalies, and trigger alerts via SMS or MQTT using async Python frameworks.

### Embedded Security & OTA Updates
Implement secure boot, encrypted storage, and automated firmware updates over-the-air with Python-based toolchains and cryptographic libraries.
