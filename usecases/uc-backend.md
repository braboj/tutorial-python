## Python Backend Use Cases

### API Service Development
Build RESTful or GraphQL endpoints to expose data and business logic for
frontend or mobile clients, using frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or Django.

### Microservices Architecture
Decompose applications into independently deployable services communicating
over HTTP or via message brokers such as RabbitMQ or Kafka.

### Authentication & Authorization
Implement secure user management, OAuth2 flows, JWT tokens, and role-based
access control with libraries like Django Allauth or PyJWT.

### Task Queues & Background Jobs
Offload long-running or periodic tasks to Celery, RQ, or Dramatiq workers for
email sending, report generation, or data cleanup.

### Data Pipelines & ETL
Extract, transform, and load large datasets from various sources into
databases or data lakes using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.

### Real-Time Data Processing
Handle streaming data, live notifications, or real-time analytics with
asyncio, WebSockets, or frameworks like Sanic and AIOHTTP.

### Message-Driven & Event-Driven Systems
React to events by publishing and consuming messages with Redis Streams,
Kafka, or MQTT for decoupled, scalable workflows.

### Caching & Performance Optimization
Integrate in-memory caches (Redis, Memcached) and design async endpoints to
reduce latency and improve throughput.

### GraphQL Backends
Offer flexible, declarative data fetching with Graphene or Ariadne, letting
clients request exactly the data they need.

### Serverless Functions
Deploy Python functions as AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, or Azure
Functions for scalable, cost-effective endpoints.

### Scheduled & Cron Jobs
Schedule recurring tasks such as database backups, report emails, or
maintenance scripts via Celery Beat or APScheduler.

### IoT & Device Backends
Manage connections, data ingestion, and command routing for Internet of Things
devices using MQTT, HTTP, or custom protocols.

### Analytics & Reporting Services
Aggregate and summarize data in dashboards or files using pandas, SQLAlchemy,
and Jinja2 templates.

### Payment Processing Integration
Securely handle transactions, webhooks, and reconciliation flows with Stripe,
PayPal, or other payment gateways.

### Logging, Monitoring & Alerts
Centralize logs with ELK stack or Prometheus integrations, and trigger alerts
via email, SMS, or Slack for critical issues.
