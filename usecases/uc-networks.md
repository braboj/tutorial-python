## Networking Use Cases with Python

### Socket Programming
Build TCP/UDP clients and servers with the `socket` module for custom network applications and services.

### HTTP Client & Server Development
Implement RESTful services using `requests`, `http.server`, Flask, or FastAPI for web communication and microservices.

### Network Automation & Orchestration
Automate device configuration and management via SSH and APIs using Netmiko, NAPALM, or Paramiko.

### Packet Crafting & Inspection
Create, send, and analyze custom packets with Scapy for testing firewalls, IDS/IPS, and protocol implementations.

### SNMP Monitoring & Management
Query and configure network devices using PySNMP to collect metrics and enforce policies.

### Network Scanning & Discovery
Use Nmap Python bindings or custom scripts to map network topology, open ports, and running services.

### Performance Testing & Benchmarking
Measure latency, throughput, and packet loss with tools like `iperf` wrappers or custom Python scripts.

### VPN & Secure Tunneling
Manage VPN connections and automate certificate distribution using OpenVPN clients and Python subprocess control.

### DNS & DHCP Automation
Interact with DNS and DHCP servers via APIs or libraries like `dnspython` to update records and leases programmatically.

### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Control network flows and policies using Ryu, POX, or ONOS Python SDKs for programmable networks.

### IoT & Device Communication
Implement MQTT, CoAP, or WebSocket protocols using `paho-mqtt` and `aiocoap` for sensor data exchange.

### Network Security Testing
Write vulnerability scanners, brute-force tools, and fuzzers leveraging Python security libraries for pentesting and hardening.

Examples of pentesting tools include:
- Scapy
- Impacket
- python-nmap
- Pwntools
- Paramiko
- Netmiko
- python-sqlmap
- Boofuzz
- Mitmproxy
- w3af Core
- dpkt
- Cryptography
