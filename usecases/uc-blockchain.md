## Blockchain Use Cases with Python

### Smart Contract Development
Write, test and deploy Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain contracts using Brownie or web3.py to automate token logic, access control and on-chain workflows.

### Decentralized Applications (dApps)
Build Python backends for web3 frontends, handling wallet integration, transaction signing and off-chain data via Flask or FastAPI.

### Token Creation & Management
Automate issuance, minting and burning of ERC-20, ERC-721 or BEP-20 tokens using web3.py scripts and contract ABIs.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols
Interact with AMMs, lending platforms and yield farms programmatically to build bots for liquidity provision, arbitrage or automated market-making.

### Blockchain Analytics & Monitoring
Use Python to index and analyze on-chain data via The Graph, Etherscan API or direct JSON-RPC calls for address activity, event tracking and metrics.

### NFT Minting & Marketplace Integration
Automate batch minting, metadata uploads to IPFS and marketplace listings (E.g., OpenSea SDK) with Python scripts.

### Supply Chain Transparency
Create provenance systems that record asset movements on Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum, querying ledgers with Python SDKs for traceability.

### Identity & Access Management
Implement self-sovereign identity flows using DID standards and Python libraries like Indy-SDK or uPort for secure authentication.

### Cross-Chain Bridges & Oracles
Build Python services that relay messages between chains or fetch off-chain data via Chainlink or custom oracle networks.

### Private & Consortium Chains
Set up and manage Hyperledger Fabric or Sawtooth networks, writing chaincode and network scripts in Python.

### Tokenomics Simulation & Modelling
Simulate token supply, burn rates and incentive models using Pandas, NumPy and networkx to predict economic outcomes.

### Automated Compliance & Reporting
Monitor transactions for AML/CFT compliance, generate audit trails and KYC reports via Python integrations with regulatory APIs.
