## Testing Use Cases with Python

### Unit Testing
Write and run isolated tests for individual functions or classes using `unittest`, `pytest` or `nose`.

### Integration Testing
Verify interactions between components or services with `pytest` fixtures and tools like `requests` to call real or mocked endpoints.

### API Testing
Automate REST/GraphQL endpoint validation using `pytest` + `requests` or specialized libraries like `schemathesis`.

### UI & Browser Testing
Drive browser‐based tests for web apps with Selenium WebDriver or Playwright’s Python bindings.

### Load & Performance Testing
Simulate user traffic and measure throughput/latency using Locust or `pytest-benchmark`.

### Contract Testing
Ensure producer/consumer service agreements hold using Pact Python or `schemathesis` for OpenAPI schemas.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
Write human-readable scenarios in Gherkin and automate them with Behave or `pytest-bdd`.

### Property-Based Testing
Generate randomized test cases against properties using Hypothesis to find edge-case failures.

### Security & Fuzz Testing
Integrate fuzzers like Atheris or boofuzz into your pipeline to uncover memory errors and injection flaws.

### Mocking & Stubbing
Isolate external dependencies by using `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock` or VCR.py to record/replay HTTP interactions.

### Test Infrastructure & CI/CD Integration
Automate test execution, reporting and gating in Jenkins, GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with Python-based runners.

### Code Coverage & Reporting
Measure and report test coverage with Coverage.py and `pytest-cov`, and generate HTML or XML reports for dashboards.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Combine database, API and UI layers in full workflows using Playwright, Selenium, Robot Framework or a custom `pytest` suite.

### Test Data Generation
Use Faker or Factory Boy to generate realistic input data for repeatable and varied test scenarios.
