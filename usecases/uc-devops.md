## DevOps Use Cases with Python

### Continuous Integration & Delivery  
Automate build, test and deployment pipelines with Python scripts using  
`jenkinsapi`, GitHub/GitLab APIs or the Azure DevOps SDK.

### Infrastructure as Code  
Provision and manage cloud resources on AWS, GCP or Azure via `boto3`,  
`google-cloud-python`, `azure-sdk-for-python` or `python-terraform`.

### Configuration Management  
Drive server and application configuration at scale using Ansible (Python-based),  
SaltStack or custom Fabric scripts.

### Containerization & Orchestration  
Build and push Docker images, manage containers and interact with Kubernetes  
via the official Python client (`kubernetes` package).

### Monitoring & Logging  
Collect metrics and logs, integrate with Prometheus, Grafana or ELK stacks  
using Python exporters, client libraries and custom health-check probes.

### Workflow Orchestration  
Define, schedule and monitor complex workflows and ETL jobs with Apache Airflow,  
Prefect or APScheduler in Python.

### Security & Compliance Automation  
Automate vulnerability scans, secret rotation and policy checks with Python  
scripts and security tool APIs (e.g., OpenSCAP, AWS Security Hub SDK).

### ChatOps & Collaboration  
Build Slack, Teams or Telegram bots using `slack-sdk` or `python-telegram-bot`  
to trigger deployments, run diagnostics and share alerts in chat.

### Site Reliability Engineering  
Implement auto-scaling triggers, canary deployments and chaos-testing scripts  
with Python to validate resilience and enforce SLAs.

### Backup & Disaster Recovery  
Script automated backups, snapshot management and restore workflows for  
databases and storage volumes using cloud SDKs and Python schedulers.

### Performance Testing & Benchmarking  
Write load-testing scenarios and measure throughput/latency of services with  
Locust or `pytest-benchmark` to identify bottlenecks.
