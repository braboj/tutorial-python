# String indexing
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This code demonstrates how to access individual characters in a string using
# indexing. In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and you can access
# each character by its index. The index starts at 0 for the first character,
# and you can also use negative indices to access characters from the end
# of the string.

string = "Hello, world!"

print(string[0])    # Print first character
# Output:
# H

print(string[1])    # Print second character
# Output:
# e

print(string[-1])   # Print last character
# Output:
# !
