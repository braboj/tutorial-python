# Complex numbers arithmetics
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The operator + can be used to add complex numbers in Python, similar to
# how it is used for integers and floats and is an example of operators
# overloading in Python. Complex numbers are represented as `a + bj`, where `a`
# is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part. The `j` suffix indicates
# the imaginary unit, which is equivalent to the square root of -1.

a = 1 + 1j
b = 1 + 1j
print(a + b)
# Output:
# (2+2j)
