# Variable as a container
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This code demonstrates how a variable can be used as a container for data.
# In this case, the variable `text` is used to store a string value, which can
# be reused multiple times in the code. The variable is a fundamental concept in
# programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data efficiently.

text = 'Hello world!'
print(text)
print(text)
print(text)
print(text)
print(text)
# Output:
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
