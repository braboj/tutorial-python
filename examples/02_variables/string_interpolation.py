# String interpolation

# This code uses f-strings (formatted string literals) to create strings

# evaluated in place.

first_name = "Branimir"
last_name = "Georgiev"
age = 25

print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name} and I am {age} years old")
# Output:
# My name is Branimir Georgiev and I am 25 years old
