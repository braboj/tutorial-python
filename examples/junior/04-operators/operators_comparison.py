# Comparison Operators in Python
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean
# value (True or False) based on the comparison.

# Initialize variables
a, b = 10, 20

# Equal
print(a == b)
# Output: False

# Not equal
print(a != b)
# Output: True

# Greater than
print(a > b)
# Output: False

# Less than
print(a < b)
# Output: True

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)
# Output: False

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)
# Output: True
