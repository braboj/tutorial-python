# Membership Operators in Python
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Membership operators are used to test whether a value is a member of a
# sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string).

a, b = 1, 5
test_list = [1, 2, 3]

# in
print(a in test_list)

# not in
print(b not in test_list)
