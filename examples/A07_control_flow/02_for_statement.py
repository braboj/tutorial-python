# Iterating over sequences using `for` loops.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loops that use the `for` statement to iterate over a sequence or other
# iterable objects are useful for executing a block of code a fixed number of
# times (we know the number of iterations in advance).

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
