# Problem without variables
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This example explains why variables are useful. Without them we would
# repeat the same value throughout the code and update each occurrence
# manually. Imagine printing "Hello world" 1000 times and later wanting
# to change it to "Hello Python"â€”we would need to edit every place it was
# written.

print("Hello world")
print("Hello world")
print("Hello world")
print("Hello world")
print("Hello world")
# Output: Hello world
