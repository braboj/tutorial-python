Math Operations Module

This module provides a set of mathematical operations, including addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Usage:
    - Import this module using 'import math_operations'.
    - Call functions using 'math_operations.add()', 'math_operations.subtract()',
        'math_operations.multiply()', and 'math_operations.divide()'.

Example:
    >>> import math
    >>> "{:.2f}".format(math.sin(math.radians(90)))
    '1.00'
    >>> "{:.2f}".format(math.cos(math.radians(90)))
    '0.00'
