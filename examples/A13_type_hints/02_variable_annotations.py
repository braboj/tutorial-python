# The `typing` module is used to provide support for type hints in Python. Type
# hints are a way to indicate the expected data types of variables, function
# parameters, and return values. This can help with code readability and
# static type checking, allowing developers to catch potential type-related
# errors before runtime.

# from typing import Any, Final

var: Final[int] = 100
