# statements

```python
# Use statements to perform actions in Python.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A statement is a piece of code that performs an action. It can be as simple
# as a single line or a more complex block of code. The following is true
# for all statements:
#
#  - A statement does not return a value.
#  - Statements cannot be used in expressions (e.g. if, while, for).
#  - It is a standalone operation.

# Valid statements
x = 5
print(x)

# Invalid statements
# if (x = 5):  # SyntaxError (statement cannot be used in an expression)
```
