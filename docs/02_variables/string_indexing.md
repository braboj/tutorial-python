# string_indexing

```python
# String indexing
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This code accesses individual characters in a string by index. Strings are
# sequences of characters, so index 0 refers to the first character, and
# negative indices let you read characters from the end of the string.

string = "Hello, world!"

print(string[0])    # Print first character
# Output:
# H

print(string[1])    # Print second character
# Output:
# e

print(string[-1])   # Print last character
# Output:
# !
```
