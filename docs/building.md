# Building the Site

This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build the static documentation site. After installing the dependencies, run:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

The generated HTML will be placed inside the `site/` directory.

You can preview the documentation locally with:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
