# Mathematical Operator Precedence in Python
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mathematical operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
# division, and their precedence determines the order in which they are e
# valuated.
#
# The precedence of mathematical operators in Python is as follows:
# 1. Parentheses
# 2. Exponentiation (**)
# 3. Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Modulus (%)
# 4. Addition (+) and Subtraction (-)
#
# !!! WARNING !!!
# The precedence of operators can lead to unexpected results if not
# understood correctly. Avoid using complex expressions without parentheses
# to ensure clarity and correctness, especially in production code.

a = 2 + 3 - 4/5  # a = 2 + 3 - (4/5)
print(a)
# Output: 4.2
