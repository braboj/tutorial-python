# Assignment Operators
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and can also
# perform operations on those values.
#
# For example, the `+=` operator adds a value to a variable and assigns the
# result back to that variable. The same applies to each of the other
# arithmetic and bitwise operators (e.g., `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `&=`, `|=`, etc.).

a = 10
b = 15

# Assign
test = a
print(test)
# Output: 10

# Add and Assign
test += b
print(test)
# Output: 25 (same as test = test + b)
```
