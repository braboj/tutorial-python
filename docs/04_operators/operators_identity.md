# Identity Operators in Python
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.
# If two variables point to the same object in memory, they are considered
# identical.

a, b, c = 10, 20, 10

print(a is b)
# Output: False

print(a is not b)
# Output: True

print(a is c)
# Output: True
