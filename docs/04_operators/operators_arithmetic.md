# Arithmetic Operators in Python
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on
# numeric values. In Python, these operators include addition, subtraction,
# multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

a, b = 3, 2

# Addition
print(a+b)
# Output: 6

# Subtraction
print(a-b)
# Output: 1

# Multiplication
print(a*b)
# Output: 6

# Division (floating point division)
print(a/b)
# Output: 1.5

# Floor Division (integer division)
print(a//b)
# Output: 1

# Modulus (remainder)
print(a % b)
# Output: 1

# Exponentiation (a to the power of b)
print(a**b)
# Output: 9
