# Logical Operators in Python
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They allow you
# to evaluate multiple conditions and return a boolean value (True or False)
# based on the evaluation.

a, b = 10, 20

# AND
print(a < 100 and b > 15)
# Output: True

# OR
print(a < 100 or b > 100)
# Output: True

# NOT
print(not(a < 100 and b > 15))
# Output: False
```
